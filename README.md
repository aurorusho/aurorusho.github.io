# DIffusion simulator

## Simulates the facilitated diffusion of sodium molecules in water across a 7nm thick mitochondrial membrane on different factors.

Index.html has a description of how js files are loaded

Diffusion.js has the main logic of the diffusion, but few or null interactions with DOM

.js files in ./utils are stand-alone functions that are being utilized by .js files in ./

The main interactions to DOM are made by divCreator.js and addData.js

(Sorry, this simulator isn't responsive yet)
